**Figure Explanation:**  
This diagram illustrates the **data write process** to the Neuromorphic X1â€™s **32Ã—32 ReRAM crossbar** via a **Wishbone interface**.  
- **1 page = 4 bytes** (one wordline)  
- Data packets (P1â€“P5) are transferred from the Wishbone bus to the **page buffer**  
- From the buffer, data is written into the corresponding rows and columns of the ReRAM crossbar  
- Each write cycle takes approximately **10 Âµs per page**, enabling fast updates while maintaining energy efficiency
